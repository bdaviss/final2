    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I grew up in southern California as the youngest of four kids. My family is very involved in the community.
        I love any water actitivty, enjoying nature, walks, good food, and time with those I love. Growing up 
        surrounded by activities and the chaos of life in a family of six, I grew to love planning engaging 
        experiences for all to enjoy. This passion ultimately led me to pursuing a career as an event planner. </p>
